[{"content":"I am Sven.\nI am a telemark skier who likes skiing with a big stick, I am a landscape photographer and time-lapser when the equipment\u0026rsquo;s weight isn\u0026rsquo;t too much, an alpine climber trying to more of an alpine climber and someone who just loves little, intricate details in everything I can see.\nI love being outside and and I love gear and so that is what the majority of the posts on this site will be - but not just gear. I love tinkering with my stuff and exploring little improvements I can make. From making my own Dyneema zipper pulls and spending months researching and testing what combination of materials yields the best \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; to just wanting to right down what I do when I go out and take some astro photos - I have some things I want to share.\nMore than anything, I would like this entire site to be a marriage between the technical specifications and hard numbers of something and this idea of feel - the things that you can\u0026rsquo;t find online about a piece you want to buy or a material you can\u0026rsquo;t buy locally. If you read something here, I want you to be able to leave the site knowing at least one thing you didn\u0026rsquo;t - even if it is subjective.\nI heard about this weird splicing tape that people use on their ice tools, but what does it feel like? What is like to put it on the aluminum shaft? What does it feel like when its frozen and is it even worth it?\nI have done my own research for weeks and think I have found the perfect bag for me. Websites tell me the exact weight, and dimensions but does it actually hold 35 liters? How does the face fabric wear over time? Does the color start to fade? Do the seams have fly-aways?\nIt is these sorts of obscure questions I would love to try and answer. If I can give people a better idea of what it will feel like to have a piece of gear and where it might let them down - because lets face it, gear will let us down somewhere but where it might do that is far more valuable in our purchasing process.\nSo, like I have said, I am not qualified enough for you to take my work completely and there is no reason for you assume what I am saying - especially about subjective stuff - will be the same for you. However, I think not enough people do this and the world of lightweight, detailed text-based information about stuff is coming back. So, these posts are for those of you like me - the gearheads, the obsessive researchers and the endless hunters for the latest and greatest methods, gear, and techniques.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about-me/","summary":"I am Sven.\nI am a telemark skier who likes skiing with a big stick, I am a landscape photographer and time-lapser when the equipment\u0026rsquo;s weight isn\u0026rsquo;t too much, an alpine climber trying to more of an alpine climber and someone who just loves little, intricate details in everything I can see.\nI love being outside and and I love gear and so that is what the majority of the posts on this site will be - but not just gear.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-holy-grail/","summary":"","title":"The Holy Grail of Sunglasses"},{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s get a couple things clear: I have had this jacket for a season, I love how warm it is, I like how packable it can be, and I think that almost everyone doesn\u0026rsquo;t need it - almost.\nSo\u0026hellip;let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nMy History With the Jacket In the winter season of 2022-2023, I bought and was using the Norrona trollveggen down850 Jacket and\u0026hellip;. it\u0026rsquo;s fine. It is heavy, the face fabrics are not my favorite, the fit isn\u0026rsquo;t the best and again\u0026hellip;it is heavy. As my friend Chris would say \u0026ldquo;it is a boat anchor of a jacket\u0026rdquo;. Additionally, I swayed between a size medium and a size small. I normally wear a small but Norrona stuff usually runs a little large for normal-sized humans. After getting a small and wearing it for a bit, I realized I should have probably stuck with a medium but I also didn\u0026rsquo;t like the jacket so I was on the search for something else.\nSo, fall of 2023 comes around and ice climbing season is in reach and trips into the ravines of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains all push me towards heavy research and nerding-out over finding a new belay jacket I would love. After a couple of weeks of non-stop looking, reading, and attempting to find real people talking about belay jackets, I land on the Arctery\u0026rsquo;x Alpha Parka.\nThe Jacket Arctery\u0026rsquo;xs self-proclaimed warmest down jacket in their lineup with revolutionary fabric technology in it that was years in the making called Hadron LCP. They claim it to be a revolution in the balance between warmth, weight, and durability - the penultimate trifecta when it comes to cold-weather layering.\nAs much as we love to see right through and criticize marketing material (and Arctery\u0026rsquo;x are professionals when it comes to showing off their gear), I must say that they are not lying. The jacket features the incredible baffles of down inside and a really great mixture of face-fabrics with a descent level of protective ripstop everywhere which protects from normal wear-and-tear as well as beads water and snow off of it and a heavier-duty ripstop near the cuffs and around the shoulders for extra protection around the ice itself, tools, screws, other hard materials and backpack straps. This heavier-duty fabric has added pieces of grid fabric across it. Unlike other ripstop fabrics with a gridded look, this one is 3-dimensional and you can feel the braided grid fabric woven in. It just feels tougher - that isn\u0026rsquo;t very quantitative but I am here to be opinionated, not scientific. If you want the pure facts, just read the Arctery\u0026rsquo;x website.\nSo, the jacket is great and I am a big fan of it. I have been able to use it on cold, humid New England winter days when you are standing waiting for a partner to get through a crux pitch and you are standing in spot that seemingly hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen the sun in months just wishing your fingers kept themselves warm without your involvement. I have brought it up in a backpack as well as attached to my harness in the stuffsack that comes with it inside and attached to the inner right stash pocket. The latter method works fine but the jacket is a dense ball of weight that hangs off a seemingly tiny drawstring cord - but if all you need is warmth while you move over some pitches fast and light, this is the way.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get into a bit more of the nitty-gritty details about the jacket that I think others do not touch on. We will just go over all the features I can find and think are worth noting.\nThe Nitty Gritty TODO: Do this with lots of photos\nThe Pros The Cons Who Is It For?
